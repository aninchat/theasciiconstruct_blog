## Introduction and topology

As a new user of Junos, I thought I'd take this opportunity to blog about what I generally start with when learning a new platform/OS. It's important to understand the basics before moving onto the more complicated configurations. For me, the basics have always included L2 protocols like STP, some form of link aggregation (LAG), at least one IGP, and then finally, understand the tools available to troubleshoot a problem on the platform. Naturally, you also need to get comfortable with navigating the CLI. 

To that end, here's the topology that we'll be using for this post:
